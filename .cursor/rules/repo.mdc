# Receipt OCR Project

## Overview

This project is a Python-based OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system specifically designed for processing English-language receipts. It uses PaddleOCR 3.x to extract structured information from receipt images. The system provides a CLI interface for batch processing receipt images from a directory and outputs structured JSON data. It's built with Click for the command-line interface and uses pathlib for robust file handling.

**Current Architecture:**
- **CLI**: Command-line interface with `run` and `info` commands
- **OCR Engine**: PaddleOCR 3.x with configurable device support (CPU/GPU)
- **Receipt Parser**: Custom logic to extract receipt structure from raw OCR text
- **Output**: Structured JSON with items, totals, and payment information
